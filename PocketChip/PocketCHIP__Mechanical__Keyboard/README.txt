# Summary

A "mechanical" keyboard faceplate for the [PocketCHIP](https://getchip.com/pages/pocketchip). 

Keys are held in place with straitened paperclips that are 1mm in diameter. This gives the keys a pivot point and reduces the amount of force needed to press each button.

Assembling only requires straitening paperclips and threading them through the holes in the case and keys.

A full print would require:

1x face plate
1x dpad
2x spacebar keys
2x backspace/enter keys
48x standard keys

I would print a few extras in case of print errors or breaks during assembly. You also may want an extra backspace/enter type key for the "P" key on the PocketCHIP. My faceplate doesn't lay completely flat and the standard key doesn't have the same click feel of the others as it's slightly higher than the rest. Using the backspace/enter key lets it reach the PCB switch dome. YMMV.

The Fusion 360 design (my first) can be found here: http://a360.co/2w4sP3R

The idea for the keys came from the [HP-35s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HP_35s) keyboard. I plan on adding some nice color-coded vinyl sticker labels similar to the [WP 34S Overlay](http://commerce.hpcalc.org/overlay.php)

Faceplate is based on the [PocketCHIP Keyboard Faceplate](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1998427) by [vjapolitzer](https://www.thingiverse.com/vjapolitzer)

V2: 2017-09-14 Added face_switch_plate_row2_through_hole.stl which makes the row 2 paperclip hole bore through to the d-pad.
